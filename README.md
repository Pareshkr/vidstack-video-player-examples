# Vidstack Examples

This repository is dedicated to showing you how to get started with Vidstack using various
JavaScript frameworks and CSS libraries.

## Local

You can run the examples locally by following these steps:

1. `git clone git@github.com:vidstack/examples.git vidstack-examples`
2. `cd vidstack-examples`
3. `pnpm i`
4. `pnpm start` - launches a process for you to select which example to run.

## Remote (recommended)

Each example has a README which contains an "Open in StackBlitz" link. If you click it, it'll
fork and launch the project in [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com). You can run the code, edit it,
and preview it inside their development environment. This is the easiest way to start playing with
the examples.
